Following things needs to be added:

1. When a user has completed the one-time Store purchase, an account should be created using their email they used to checkout. Also an Store order for their account will be created. After successful purchase, an email including a magic-link should be sent out and they will be asked to set a full name aswell as a password.

2. Upon accessing their Dashboard, a notification will popup on the "Butik" (/store) page saying that they will need to choose a niche for their store. Once selected a niche, their store order will be updated with this information.
