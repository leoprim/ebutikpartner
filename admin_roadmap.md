Things to add in the admin side of the platform:

1. A product section where all uploaded products will be visible in the list. A "LÃ¤gg till produkt" button should be placed somewhere to easily paste link from Alibaba to import the products.

When applying a link from Alibaba, you should import and retrieve information such as variants, product description, title and images. Before saving the product, I should be able to edit the imported product.

2. When viewing the details of a store, there should be an input where the admin enters the Shopify store domain, for example "sdgy73fd.myshopify.com" and when below it should be a input for entering the stores access token. This will allow the admin to create a store manually in Shopify and link it to a specific order.
